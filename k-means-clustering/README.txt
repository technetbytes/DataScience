In this IPython Notebook we are going to see the K-Means machine learning algorithm implementation using scikit-learn and bokeh plotting library.

K-Means Clustering:
-------------------
K-Means is the simplest and the best known un-supervised clustering alogrithm. The aims of this algorithm, is to partition a set of objects, based on their attributes, into k clusters or center points also called centroid, where k is, a predefined or user-defined constant. The main goal is to classify data into groups of information.
